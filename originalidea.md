## Idea

Sometimes I want a quote from the 10th century talking about free trade. Using semantic search I think I can do this.

## Roadmap
format easy test, e.g. https://gist.github.com/erickedji/68802 (TY!)
embed all quotes
setup search function

### Later:
local flask server
hosting
more data sources
better parsing

think about what format to hold data in - possibly xml
